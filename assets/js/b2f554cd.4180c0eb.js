Gloo is a modular toolkit for building fast, reliable\\nWeb applications and libraries with Rust and WASM.\\n\\n## What\'s new\\n\\nThis release focuses on adding new features and crates.\\n\\n### New crate: `gloo-worker`\\n\\nGloo workers are a way to offload tasks to web workers. These are run concurrently using\\n[web-workers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Workers_API/Using_web_workers).\\n\\nThis feature has been requested and overdue for a while. Gloo-worker is made by \\nmoving [`yew-agent`](https://yew.rs/docs/concepts/agents) to Gloo, while making it framework independent in the process.\\nThis allows us to have a neat abstraction over the browser\'s Web Workers API which can be consumed from anywhere.\\n\\n### Features\\n\\nThis release has been light on new features. The only improvement is `gloo_utils` now providing a new wrapper \\nto obtain the document `head`.\\n\\n## Notable mention from last release\\n\\nLast release, Gloo v0.5.0 did not receive its own blog post. That released introduced one major new crate: `gloo-history`\\namongst other small improvements, which can be found in the [GitHub changelog](https://github.com/rustwasm/gloo/releases/tag/0.5.0).\\n\\n### `gloo-history`\\n\\nGloo history provides wrappers for browser\'s history API. It exposes ergonomic Rust APIs for the browser\'s APIs which \\ncan be used to build other tools. In fact, [`yew-router`](https://github.com/yewstack/yew/pull/2239) has been \\nreworked to use `gloo-history` under-the-hood.\\n\\n## Looking for contributors\\n\\nGloo project is in need of contributors.
